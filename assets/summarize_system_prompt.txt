# Summary

Brett Adcock, founder and CEO of Figure AI, discusses his company's mission to develop humanoid robots for general-purpose use. He explains the rationale behind choosing a humanoid form, the technological advancements enabling this development, and the challenges faced in creating such complex systems. Adcock also touches on the company's vertical integration, product development process, and future goals for deploying robots in industrial and home settings

# Topics Breakdown

## 1. Brett Adcock's Background and Path to Humanoid Robots

**Q: Can you talk about your journey from farming to software to vertical take-off and landing to humanoid robots?**

A: I grew up on a farm in Illinois and got into coding at an early age. I've spent about 20 years building companies - over 10 in software and under 10 in hardware. I started a software company, sold it, then started Archer Aviation for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. About 21 months ago, I started Figure.

> "The thesis here is that if you assume the technologies are possible, to build a humanoid robot... It's going to be the biggest business in the world, by probably order of magnitude."

## 2. Why Humanoid Robots?

**Q: Why does being humanoid matter? Why not other forms of robots?**

A: The whole world was built for humans and around humans. If we want to automate work, we want to build a general interface to that world. The human form is that interface - you can do everything a human can. Building one hardware system that can do everything is more efficient than creating specialized robots for every task.

> "We can either rebuild like thousands or millions of special types of robots that do special use cases all over the world, or we could build a humanoid robot."

## 3. Technological Advancements Enabling Humanoid Robots

**Q: Why is now the right time for humanoid robots?**

A: Several factors make it possible now:
1. Improved power systems (batteries and motors)
2. Advanced locomotion controllers
3. AI systems and computation power
4. Speech interfaces
